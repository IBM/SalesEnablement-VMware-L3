#
#VMware Solutions Shared is built around three key pillars:

1. **Cost-effective scalability**: customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater effiencies). As a result, customers can minimize their unused capacity and save money. Instead of buying fixed-size virtual machines, clients can instead purchase compute capacity (as needed) and provision any number of virtual machines (of different sizes) within the capacity limit they set.

2. **Temporary migration, co-location, and burst**: multi-site data centers can be consolidated within a single location by migrating workloads from different sources.

3. **Disaster recovery**: a suite of pre-installed services— Veeam Availability Suite, Veeam Cloud Connect, and Zerto —together provide options for disaster recover of critical workloads, achieving recovery point objectives (RPOs) within seconds, and maintaing application consistency.
