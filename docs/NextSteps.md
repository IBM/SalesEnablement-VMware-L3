This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated several of the {{offering.name}} offerings available. Users learned the basics for provisioning and managing both VMware Shared and VMware vCenter Server resources. But there is still more to learn about {{offering.name}}. Links to specific topics were provided throughout this demonstration guide. Take the time to read the official VMware documentation here:

- <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage" target="_blank">COS documentation</a> to learn the full capabilities of the offering.

And check out this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware/compare_offerings" target="_blank">offering comparison page</a> as well.

Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan when preparing the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. Remember, take the quiz while the reservation to the TechZone environment is active. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-thru demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.
