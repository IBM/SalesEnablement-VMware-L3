The IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions shared offering is deprecated and no longer supported after 15 January 2025. Clients can use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) to migrate workloads from their IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared virtual data center (VDC) to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service. 

Documentation on how to perform this migration is documented in the *Migration tutorials* in the product documentation that is located <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcda-migrating-cloudtocloud-shared" target="_blank">here</a>. Included in the documentation is a video that shows how the migration is performed similar to the following click-through demonstrations.

Due to the permissions necessary to perform this type of migration, it is not possible to use the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that is provided with this learning plan. However, two click-through demonstrations are provided to illustrate this migration process. Instead of providing step-by-step instructions in the demonstration guide, the first click-through provides on-screen callouts that describe the steps and includes control buttons at the bottom to navigate through the demonstration. The second click-through does not include the callouts but does include the highlight boxes to assist in stepping through the process.

!!! tip
    
    When using the click-through demonstration, if you are not sure where to click or what to do next, simply click anywhere on the screen and the place to click next will be highlighted. Text entry fields are pre-populated in the click-through demonstration.
