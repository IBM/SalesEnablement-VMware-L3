Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCS instance. Note, fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration. Tip Not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted. Open the link below and then click the play button to begin the demonstration. Click-thru demo: Provision an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions Dedicated Click the VMware icon in the left-hand menu bar. Click the VMware vCenter Server tile. Click in the Instance name text entry field. The Instance name field will automatically change to vcs-l3. Click the Resource Group pull-down menu. Select the Enablement-L3 option. NEED TO DISCUSS INSTANCE TYPES NEED TO DISCUSS LICENSING Click Licensing in the left-hand menu. Under the NSX section, click the pull-down menu that currently shows Data Center SP Professional . Select the Data Center SP Advanced option. In this deployment, a single Consolidated cluster will be used. Consolidated clusters are used for both the management components of the VCS deployment as well as client workloads. This is typically fine for small deployments, and will potentially save the client some money. However, for larger deployments with varying performance requirements for workloads, separating the management cluster from other workload clusters is the preferred architecture. Refer to the documentation for more details on management and workload clusters here . Later the other options for to provision dedicated Workload and Edge services clusters will be explored, but for this environment a single Consolidated cluster is used. Under Data center location , click the Geography pull-down menu that currently shows NA South . Notice, VCS instances can be deployed in many of the IBM Cloud data centers located around the world. Select the NA West option. Select the SJC04 data center option. Next, a hardware configuration for the bare-metal servers needs to be specified. VCS can be provisioned on many different hardware configurations, including SAP certified hardware. Click the Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4210 radio button in the CPU model table. Click the RAM pull-down menu that currently shows 768 GB . Select the 128 GB option. NEED TO DISCUSS # of servers, storage, vsan/nfs, shares, network type, uplink speeds, and vlans Click the Include a separate, additional workload cluster. checkbox. Notice the form expands to allow a new hardware configuration to be specified for a separate Workload cluster just like for the Consolidated cluster. If a client desires to separate their workload cluster from the management cluster, this option should be selected. Often clients will opt for multiple workload cluster based upon the CPU, memory, and storage requirements of the workloads. Click the Include a separate, additional workload cluster. checkbox again to disable the separate Workload cluster . Click the Edge services cluster checkbox. A dedicated Edge services cluster is often desirable for large deployments that require additional separation of the edge services and custom firewall components. Notice the hardware options for the Edge services cluster are fewer than for the Consolidate and Workload clusters. Click the Edge services cluster checkbox agin to disable the separate Edge services cluster . Click the Domain name text entry field under the Network interface section. NEED TO DISCUSS DNS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS A valid Domain name needs to be specified for the VCS deployment. The Domain name field will automatically change to myroot.mydomain.com for this environment. Notice how both the Hostname prefix and Domain name fields are used to specify the complete hostnames for the bare-metal servers. The Configure host names individually checkbox can be used for clients that desire to specify hostnames individually. Click the Add-on services option in left-hand menu. intro to additional Services Click the Edit link in the Veeam 11 tile under Recommended services . discuss Veeam Click the Name text entry field in the Configure Veeam dialog. The Name field will automatically change to veeam-l3 . Click the Storage size pull-down menu that currently shows 4000 GB . Select the 2000 GB option. discuss sizing veeam Click the Storage performance pull-down menu that currently shows 0.25 IOPS/GB . discuss storage performance Select the 0.25 IOPS/GB option.
