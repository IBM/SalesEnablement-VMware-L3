Welcome to the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions - Level 3 course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of VMware Shared and VMware Dedicated plans via the IBM Cloud. WARNING In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. User identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. Permission to create or modify VMware service instances, virtual machines (instances), networks, images, etc. is not provided. The demonstration guide provides videos and click through demonstrations to cover these functions. All modules are accompanied by recordings and narrated instructions, delivered by your team of authors. Be sure to watch these for a visual demonstration of how to perform the hands-on lab components. In particular, it is strongly recommended that IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers watch these recordings \u2014 they will be useful for you as you go about creating and recording your own Stand & Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation. ACCREDITATION To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course.

IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared provides customizable deployment choices of VMware Virtual Data Center environments, all provisioned through automation via the IBM Cloud for standardized, reliable, enterprise-ready deployments. VMware Shared virtual data center instances can quickly and seamlessly migrate or deploy VMware workloads to the cloud \u2014 on top of IBM-hosted and VMware-certified infrastructure. The service is HIPAA-enabled, provides IAM out of the box, and is validated for financial services use cases. IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared is built around three key pillars: Cost-effective scalability : customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater efficiencies). As a result, customers can minimize their unused capacity and save money. Instead of buying fixed-size virtual machines, clients can instead purchase compute capacity (as needed) and provision any number of virtual machines (of different sizes) within the capacity limit they set. Temporary migration, co-location, and burst : multi-site data centers can be consolidated within a single location by migrating workloads from different sources. Disaster recovery : a suite of pre-installed services\u2014 Veeam Availability Suite, Veeam Cloud Connect, and Zerto \u2014provide options for disaster recover of critical workloads, achieving recovery point objectives (RPOs) within seconds, and maintaining application consistency. The offering is ideal for enterprise clients that are currently operating VMware workloads on-premises, but need to adopt cloud as part of their digital transformation and modernization strategy. The automation and added support that is made available through an IBM Cloud deployment speeds the time to delivery and lowers the risks that would otherwise be present if a client attempted to \"roll their own\" cloud deployment. Furthermore, the infrastructure supported by IBM Cloud is competitively priced and managed by IBM \u2014 ensuring that capital expenditures stay low. The scalability of cloud supports a pathway to further growth and investment, as well: Shared plan customers needing additional capacity or dedicated infrastructure have the flexibility to license IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Dedicated offerings on the same cloud, should they need it. Steps Ahead In the following modules, you will: Explore the process of provisioning a VMware Shared plan via the IBM Cloud. Delve deeper into various elements of the offering's management console, including: data centers, applications, virtual machines, networking, libraries, platform administration, and system monitoring.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Shared/Introduction/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Introduction/#ibm-cloud-for-vmware-solutions-shared-is-built-around-three-key-pillars","text":"Cost-effective scalability : customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater efficiencies).

The following module guides business partners and IBM sellers through the myriad of features and management tools available from within the VMware Shared platform dashboard on IBM Cloud. You will explore various elements of the management panels and tooling, including: data centers, applications, virtual machines, networking, libraries, platform administration, and system monitoring. VMWare Solutions, including the Shared plan and other tiers, are accessible through the VMware portal on IBM Cloud . Accessing the vCloud Director console Ensure that your IBM Cloud account is using the ITZ-VMWARE account that you were invited to as part of the prerequisite setup for this hands-on material. From the IBM Cloud dashboard, click the VMware tab from the left-hand navigation menu, or alternatively search for VMware Solutions in the search bar. WARNING If you continue with the following instructions using your personal IBM Cloud account, there is a risk that your account (and credit card associated with that personal account) will be billed for provisioning a VMware Solutions deployment. To avoid any unwanted charges, ensure that your account is switched to ITZ-VMWARE before continuing. Drill down into the Resources tab within the left-hand navigation menu. From the variety of VMware Solutions plans available, click on the VMware Shared tab. An instance of VMware Shared should already be set up, having completed the Provisioning section earlier. Locate the instance\u2014 Dallas Director 01 in the example screenshot below, although the naming of your instance may differ \u2014and click the name of the instance to pull open a Summary page. The browser will load a Summary panel for the VMware Shared instance, supplying details on access controls for your platform, virtual data centers associated with the deployment, and additional services that can be used in conjunction with the platform. Before you can connect to the VMware Shared instance, you need to set an administrative password for the vCloud Director console . Do so by clicking the Reset site admin password button as shown. A dialogue window will open, asking you to confirm an administrative password reset for the instance. Confirm the selection and wait for the reset to complete. The User name will always be set to admin by default. The Password will be uniquely generated each time a reset is conducted. Click the \"eyeball\" icon to view the password and the \"box\" icon to copy the password to your machine's clipboard. Record both of these values to a notepad \u2014 you will need to reference these later for connecting to the vCloud Director console. Click the Close button to continue. Back on the Summary page, locate the vCloud Director console button near the top-right of the screen. Before resetting the admin password, this button would have been greyed out and inaccessible. With the password reset complete, the button is now active (blue) \u2014 click it to continue to the console login page. A new tab or window will open, prompting you to log in to the vCloud Director console. If one does not appear, check to make sure a pop-up blocker is not active. Use the admin and password fields recorded in Step 6 to log in to the console. After successfully authenticating, your browser will redirect to the vCloud Director console . From this page, you will be able to access many of the administrative functions for the VMware Shared environment (with some restrictions in place to ensure the safety and stability of the deployment). By default, the console will load to the Data Centers tab. Here you can inspect details on the virtual data center supporting your environment, which in the case of the example screenshot below is the bienko-vdc environment which was set up during the Provisioning section earlier. A summary of the VDC's vCPU, memory, and storage utilization is provided at the bottom of the page. Let's explore other elements of the vCloud Director console. From the navigation menu along the top of the console dashboard, click the Applications tab. Managing Applications and Virtual Machines The console's Applications dashboard allows for the centralized management and deployment of all applications\u2014 which are categorized as either virtual machines or virtual applications \u2014within the VMware Shared environment. A virtualized application, or vApp , consists of one or more virtual machines (VMs) that communicate over the Shared plan's network, making use of the Shared plan's resources, or invoking services that the Shared plan supports. A single vApp can consist of one, or multiple, VMs as part of its backbone. Let's try drafting a new virtualized application from scratch. Do so by clicking the New vApp button from the menu at the bottom of the page. The first order of business is selecting which Virtual Data Center that the virtual application will be assigned to. By default, you should see the VDC environment that was created earlier ( bienko-vdc in the example screenshot below). Click Next to continue. The new vApp will require a Name ( vAppSample ) and a Description ( Demonstration purposes only ). The Power On toggle can be left OFF for now, as we will not be deploying this example vApp to a live state. No virtual machines currently exist within the VMware Shared VDC environment, but if they did they would be listed within the table presented on this page. Instead, you will need to craft your own. Click the Add Virtual Machine button below the table to define a new VM. A new configuration window will open. Provide a Name ( BienkoVM ) and Computer Name ( BienkoVM ), as well as an optional Description , for the new VM. The VM can either be crafted from scratch ( New ) or from a pre-designed template ( From Template ). One of the advantages of the VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud is the wealth of templates available out of the box with the offering. Select the From Template option and then scroll through the template repository. We recommend selecting the vm-redhat8 template, which corresponds to the Red Hat 8 official release (RHEL8), for the purposes of this demonstration \u2014 although you are free to choose any of your liking. Continue scrolling down the page to reveal more configuration options. Storage for the VM is our next consideration. As described earlier in the Provisioning module, there are a variety of storage options available for virtual machines and virtual applications deployed within the VMware Shared environment. Each storage tier provides different levels of throughput (IOPs) and levels of isolation (multi-tenant versus single-tenant), with differing levels of billable rates and charges associated with each tier. For our purposes, we recommend the Standard (VDC Default) tier of Storage Policy . Compute is dictated by the VDC sizing configuration that was set during the Provisioning module. The resources available to the VM we are defining here are restricted by the hardware configurations assigned to the VDC ( bienko-vdc ) when it was deployed earlier. NICs , or Network Interface Cards, provide the network interface needed by the virtual machine for communication with the public internet, IBM Cloud, and on-premises resources. The Primary NIC will have been configured by default and no other adjustments are required. When satisfied, click the OK button at the bottom of the panel to return to the vApp definition. (A): A summary panel will now display outlining the full configuration of the vApp. To avoid incurring any unnecessary charges, click the Cancel button to return to the Applications tab. Creating vApps from a Template (B): An alternative to defining a vApp from scratch is to select from the pre-built catalog of vApps that are packaged with every VMware Shared deployment on IBM Cloud. To inspect the resources available, click the Add vApp from Catalog button at the bottom of the page. A configuration window will open to configure a cataloged virtual application. First, select from the list of pre-built templates. For our demonstration purposes, we recommend selecting the CentOS-7-Template-Official , but do take the time to browse the available options for yourself before continuing. When satisfied with your selection, click Next . The vApp will require a Name ( BienkoVAppTemplate ) and optional Description . The Runtime lease field determines the length of time that the vApp can run within the VDC before its access to system resources is paused. The Storage lease field sets the time that the vApp remains available, from the moment it is stopped (when the Runtime lease expires). After the Storage lease has expired, clean-up of the vApp resources and associated data will begin automatically. For our demonstration purposes, both the Runtime lease and Storage lease fields can be set to Never Expires . When satisfied, click Next to continue. The resources to which the vApp has permitted access to are configured on the following page. As described in Step 18 , there are a variety of Storage Policies available \u2014 with differing metering and pricing metrics associated with each tier. For the purposes of our demonstration, configure the vm-centos07 vApp to utilize the Standard Storage Tier . Per-Disk Storage Policies are configured in the second table of this panel. You must Select a VM , which should be automatically populated to vm-centos07 (or the VM naming that you specified earlier). By default, the Storage Policy will inherit the type of storage specified in Step 28 ( Standard ). When satisfied, click Next to continue. The vApp's Compute Policies are configured next. The total number of vCPUs that the vApp can access are determined by the Virtual CPUs field ( 2 ) and the constraints on Cores per Socket that can be accessed per vCPU are determined by the second field ( 1 ). The Number of Sockets is fixed at 2 for our example. The maximum amount of RAM available to the vApp is determined by the Memory field ( 8 GB ). When satisfied, click Next to continue. The Customize Hardware panel will allow you to configure the hardware\u2014 storage, in our case \u2014available to the virtual machines running as a part of this vApp. Recall that a vApp can be comprised of one, or many, virtual machines. The Hard Disks associated with the vApp have been configured automatically to a size of 64GB . When satisfied, click Next to continue. Via the Configure Networking panel, you can specify and constrain the virtual networks that VMs running within the vApp will be able to connect to. These variables can also be adjusted after the vApp has been configured and launched. The vApp ( vm-centos07 ) to which these networking configurations will be applied has been selected automatically. You must specify the Network field for this vApp: select the vAppNet-vro-template-network from the list of pre-configured networking templates. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Additional properties can be configured via the Custom Properties tab. Should you wish, you can assign a custom hostname for guests via the guest.hostname property for this vApp. Leave this field blank. When satisfied, click Next to continue. The Ready to Complete panel provides a full summary of your vApp (from Template) configurations. Here you can review the vApp before choosing to commit to a deployment, or discard the vApp configuration completely. CAUTION For our purposes, it is NOT necessary to deploy the vApp \u2014 this will incur costs to the IBM Cloud account. Click the Cancel button to avoid any billing charges. The web browser will automatically be redirected back to the Applications tab of the vCloud Director console. Managing Networks From the dashboard of the vCloud Director console, switch to the Networking tab using the navigation bar along the top of the page. From this management screen, you can access information on the VMware Shared plan's available Networks , Edge Gateways , Data Center Groups , and Security Tags . By default, the Networks associated with the deployment will be displayed first \u2014 at this time, your environment should contain no defined networks. Click the New button, as shown in the screenshot below, to create a new network configuration. A new page will load to guide you through the process of defining an organization-wide virtual data center (VDC) network. The first element to be defined is the overall Scope of the network. The Scope of the network can be constrained to either an organization-wide VDC (providing connectivity only across the virtual machines belonging to that particular VDC), or across a data center group (connectivity across all VDCs belonging to that group, inclusive of all VMs belonging to those VDCs). Select the Organization Virtual Data Center option to keep networking connectivity restricted to only one VDC. Given the selection made in Step 43 , you will need to specify the organization VDC to which these constraints will apply. Select the VDC defined earlier ( bienko-vdc in this example). When satisfied, click Next to continue. You must now decide the Network Type appropriate for this deployment. There are two options: Routed : A network type that utilizes an edge gateway to enable controlled access to networks and machines external to (outside of) the VDC. Isolated : A network type that is only accessible by the VDC (or associated VDC Groups) specified in Step 44 , thereby providing a fully isolated environment. Select the Routed Network Type. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Having selected the Routed network type in Step 46 , which makes use of an edge gateway for regulated access to the network, we must now define an Edge Connection for the organization VDC. The configuration tool will automatically designate an edge connection ( edge-dal10-67c6f68e for the Dallas Director 01 data center) with 2 External Networks and 0 Org VDC Networks. Next, you must choose the type of Edge Connection to be applied. There are three options: Internal : For connecting to one of the edge gateway's internal interfaces. The maximum number of supported network connections is 9 . Distributed : For connecting via fast and efficient East-West routing. The network will be connected to an internal interface of a distributed router that is exclusively associated with this gateway. The maximum number of supported network connections is 400 . Subinterface : For connecting to the edge gateway's internal trunk interface. The maximum number of supported network connections is 200 . Select the Internal Edge Connection type. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Provide a unique Name for the organization VDC network ( BienkoNetwork ) and optionally a basic Description to its purpose. A Gateway CIDR must be assigned, which includes the IP address of the gateway. This value cannot be changed once assigned. In our example, the CIDR of 192.168.100.14/24 represents the gateway address of 192.168.100.14 and its associated routing prefix of 192.168.100.0 ; or equivalently, its subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 . Assign a CIDR of 192.168.100.14/24 and leave the Dual-Stack Mode option disabled. For our purposes, the network is not to be Shared : therefore, leave this option disabled. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Static IP Pools must now be assigned to the Gateway CIDR assigned earlier in Step 52 . Verify that the CIDR displayed on this panel matches the one that you designated previously. You may enable whichever range of IP addresses you wish; however, for the sake of example, let's assign a range of 7 IP addresses by entering 192.168.100.15 - 192.168.100.20 into the form as shown. Portable IP addresses are available to all resources on a VLAN, whereas static IP addresses are available to the resource identified as their routing endpoint. Click the Add button after entering the IP address ranges to add them to the Static IP Pool. When satisfied, click Next to continue. DNS , or the Domain Name System, provides the mapping between IP addresses (such as the ones specified earlier) and the \"name\" address that you typically enter into a web browser ( www.google.com , for example). A DNS relay can be enabled for the edge gateway previously configured; however, the DNS relay must be set before deployment and cannot be modified after the fact. Enable the Use Edge DNS slider. The remaining fields below can remain blank. When satisfied, click Next to continue. The Ready to Complete panel provides a full summary of your organization VDC network configurations. Here you can review the details of the network before choosing to commit to a deployment, or discard the network configuration completely. Click the Finish button to create the network. Your browser will automatically redirect to the Networking tab of the vCloud Director console. From the list of subdirectories along the top of the screen, drill down into the Edge Gateways panel as shown. The panel will summarize all of the Edge Gateways currently deployed on the VMware Shared platform, including the one we just created ( edge-dal10-67c6f68e ). Click the Name of that Edge Gateway (your name may differ from the example shown) to expand additional details about it. Generalized information about the Edge Gateway are displayed on the details page. Explore each of the subdirectories\u2014 Services , Redeploy , Enable Distributed Routing , Sync Syslog , and Open in VDC Context \u2014to glimpse more of the administrative options available for your newly-created Edge Gateway and organization VDC network. Information and configuration options related to External Networks are available from the navigation menu on the left side of the panel. Additional Capabilities and Tooling For the purposes of this hands-on demonstration, we won't go too deeply into detail on other areas of the VMware Solutions Shared plan environment. Until live applications, virtualized machines, and a workforce of users are actively engaged with the platform, these other areas of the vCloud Director console will remain relatively quiet. However, we have included pointers below to relevant areas that may spark interest and conversations with clients. Feel free to peruse these areas and explore topics that may be pertinent to your customer engagements. Using the navigation tabs along the top of the console, explore the Libraries tab. Here you can investigate more details on the vApp templates that were touched on earlier in this hands-on material. Users can expand the number of templates available within their own environment by importing them directly from VMware's vCenter. From the Administration tab, a myriad of options for user management and access control are available. Here, VMware Shared users with administrative privileges can create new users, groups for those users, and roles for users to be assigned to. Identity providers, policies, certificates, and other security settings can also be implemented from this page. As an example, the screenshot below emulates the Create User panel. A user vAppAuthor is defined and an authentication password is assigned. The Roles field determines the level of privileged access and capabilities granted to the user. An administrator responsible for creating the user will be able to select from a variety of Roles (pre-built or admin-defined), such as vApp Author , that enable a user to carry out their expected job responsibilities without compromising the security of the VMware Shared platform as a whole. Quotas can be applied to the user, limiting how many VMs (running or paused) that said user can manage within the platform. Discard any changes made to the user and group definitions. Lastly, from the Monitoring tab it is possible for administrative users to inspect running Tasks and Events across the platform. Click on any of the task or event names to drill down into more granular details surrounding that item. When you have completed your tour of the vCloud Director console, click the username dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard and Log Out to end your session. At this point in time, you have successfully explored the myriad of features and management tools available from within the VMware Shared dashboard on IBM Cloud. You should now have greater familiarity and fluency with the various elements of the management panels and tooling, including: how to manage data centers, building applications and virtual machines through the guided web interface, establishing networking rules, and the wealth of tooling available for managing the environment once in production. In the following chapter, you will investigate IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Dedicated .","title":"Managing"},{"location":"Shared/Managing/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Managing/#accessing-the-vcloud-director-console","text":"Ensure that your IBM Cloud account is using the ITZ-VMWARE account that you were invited to as part of the prerequisite setup for this hands-on material.

WARNING If you continue with the following instructions using your personal IBM Cloud account, there is a risk that your account (and credit card associated with that personal account) will be billed for provisioning a VMware Solutions deployment. To avoid any unwanted charges, ensure that your account is switched to ITZ-VMWARE before continuing. Drill down into the Resources tab within the left-hand navigation menu. From the variety of VMware Solutions plans available, click on the VMware Shared tab. An instance of VMware Shared should already be set up, having completed the Provisioning section earlier. Locate the instance\u2014 Dallas Director 01 in the example screenshot below, although the naming of your instance may differ \u2014and click the name of the instance to pull open a Summary page. The browser will load a Summary panel for the VMware Shared instance, supplying details on access controls for your platform, virtual data centers associated with the deployment, and additional services that can be used in conjunction with the platform. Before you can connect to the VMware Shared instance, you need to set an administrative password for the vCloud Director console . Do so by clicking the Reset site admin password button as shown. A dialogue window will open, asking you to confirm an administrative password reset for the instance. Confirm the selection and wait for the reset to complete. The User name will always be set to admin by default. The Password will be uniquely generated each time a reset is conducted. Click the \"eyeball\" icon to view the password and the \"box\" icon to copy the password to your machine's clipboard. Record both of these values to a notepad \u2014 you will need to reference these later for connecting to the vCloud Director console. Click the Close button to continue. Back on the Summary page, locate the vCloud Director console button near the top-right of the screen. Before resetting the admin password, this button would have been greyed out and inaccessible. With the password reset complete, the button is now active (blue) \u2014 click it to continue to the console login page. A new tab or window will open, prompting you to log in to the vCloud Director console. If one does not appear, check to make sure a pop-up blocker is not active. Use the admin and password fields recorded in Step 6 to log in to the console. After successfully authenticating, your browser will redirect to the vCloud Director console . From this page, you will be able to access many of the administrative functions for the VMware Shared environment (with some restrictions in place to ensure the safety and stability of the deployment). By default, the console will load to the Data Centers tab. Here you can inspect details on the virtual data center supporting your environment, which in the case of the example screenshot below is the bienko-vdc environment which was set up during the Provisioning section earlier. A summary of the VDC's vCPU, memory, and storage utilization is provided at the bottom of the page. Let's explore other elements of the vCloud Director console. From the navigation menu along the top of the console dashboard, click the Applications tab.","title":"Accessing the vCloud Director console"},{"location":"Shared/Managing/#_2","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Managing/#managing-applications-and-virtual-machines","text":"The console's Applications dashboard allows for the centralized management and deployment of all applications\u2014 which are categorized as either virtual machines or virtual applications \u2014within the VMware Shared environment. A virtualized application, or vApp , consists of one or more virtual machines (VMs) that communicate over the Shared plan's network, making use of the Shared plan's resources, or invoking services that the Shared plan supports. A single vApp can consist of one, or multiple, VMs as part of its backbone. Let's try drafting a new virtualized application from scratch. Do so by clicking the New vApp button from the menu at the bottom of the page. The first order of business is selecting which Virtual Data Center that the virtual application will be assigned to. By default, you should see the VDC environment that was created earlier ( bienko-vdc in the example screenshot below). Click Next to continue. The new vApp will require a Name ( vAppSample ) and a Description ( Demonstration purposes only ). The Power On toggle can be left OFF for now, as we will not be deploying this example vApp to a live state. No virtual machines currently exist within the VMware Shared VDC environment, but if they did they would be listed within the table presented on this page. Instead, you will need to craft your own. Click the Add Virtual Machine button below the table to define a new VM. A new configuration window will open. Provide a Name ( BienkoVM ) and Computer Name ( BienkoVM ), as well as an optional Description , for the new VM. The VM can either be crafted from scratch ( New ) or from a pre-designed template ( From Template ). One of the advantages of the VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud is the wealth of templates available out of the box with the offering. Select the From Template option and then scroll through the template repository. We recommend selecting the vm-redhat8 template, which corresponds to the Red Hat 8 official release (RHEL8), for the purposes of this demonstration \u2014 although you are free to choose any of your liking. Continue scrolling down the page to reveal more configuration options. Storage for the VM is our next consideration. As described earlier in the Provisioning module, there are a variety of storage options available for virtual machines and virtual applications deployed within the VMware Shared environment. Each storage tier provides different levels of throughput (IOPs) and levels of isolation (multi-tenant versus single-tenant), with differing levels of billable rates and charges associated with each tier. For our purposes, we recommend the Standard (VDC Default) tier of Storage Policy . Compute is dictated by the VDC sizing configuration that was set during the Provisioning module. The resources available to the VM we are defining here are restricted by the hardware configurations assigned to the VDC ( bienko-vdc ) when it was deployed earlier. NICs , or Network Interface Cards, provide the network interface needed by the virtual machine for communication with the public internet, IBM Cloud, and on-premises resources. The Primary NIC will have been configured by default and no other adjustments are required. When satisfied, click the OK button at the bottom of the panel to return to the vApp definition.

First, select from the list of pre-built templates. For our demonstration purposes, we recommend selecting the CentOS-7-Template-Official , but do take the time to browse the available options for yourself before continuing. When satisfied with your selection, click Next . The vApp will require a Name ( BienkoVAppTemplate ) and optional Description . The Runtime lease field determines the length of time that the vApp can run within the VDC before its access to system resources is paused. The Storage lease field sets the time that the vApp remains available, from the moment it is stopped (when the Runtime lease expires). After the Storage lease has expired, clean-up of the vApp resources and associated data will begin automatically. For our demonstration purposes, both the Runtime lease and Storage lease fields can be set to Never Expires . When satisfied, click Next to continue. The resources to which the vApp has permitted access to are configured on the following page. As described in Step 18 , there are a variety of Storage Policies available \u2014 with differing metering and pricing metrics associated with each tier.

You must Select a VM , which should be automatically populated to vm-centos07 (or the VM naming that you specified earlier). By default, the Storage Policy will inherit the type of storage specified in Step 28 ( Standard ). When satisfied, click Next to continue. The vApp's Compute Policies are configured next. The total number of vCPUs that the vApp can access are determined by the Virtual CPUs field ( 2 ) and the constraints on Cores per Socket that can be accessed per vCPU are determined by the second field ( 1 ). The Number of Sockets is fixed at 2 for our example. The maximum amount of RAM available to the vApp is determined by the Memory field ( 8 GB ). When satisfied, click Next to continue.

The following module will guide business partners and IBM sellers through the process of provisioning a VMware Shared plan via the IBM Cloud. Along the way, additional context around sizing and configuration of the offering will be provided, illustrating the value of these features to end-users, and pointers supplied to additional resources for those looking to dig deeper. VMWare Solutions, including the Shared plan and other tiers, are accessible through the VMware portal on IBM Cloud . From the IBM Cloud dashboard, click the VMware tab on the left-hand navigation menu, or alternatively Search for VMware Solutions in the search bar at the top of the page. Ensure that your IBM Cloud account is using the ITZ-VMWARE account that you were invited to as part of the prerequisite setup for this hands-on material. You can switch to ITZ-VMWARE by clicking the drop-down selector in the top-right corner of the IBM Cloud interface, as shown in the screenshot below. WARNING If you continue with the following instructions using your personal IBM Cloud account, there is a risk that your account (and credit card associated with that personal account) will be billed for provisioning a VMware Solutions deployment. To avoid any unwanted charges, ensure that your account is switched to ITZ-VMWARE before continuing. With your account properly set, you can proceed with configuration and setup of a VMware Shared plan. There are four platforms currently provided for VMware on IBM Cloud: VMware Shared , VMware as a Service , VMware vSphere , and VMware vCenter Server . For the purposes of this module, you will be configuring and provisioning a VMware Shared platform. As shown in the screenshot below, select the VMware Shared tile and click Create to continue to the configuration page. The web browser will redirect to a new page, where you will be asked to provide detailed configuration options for various elements of the VMware Shared platform environment that IBM Cloud is to deploy. Pricing Plans ON-DEMAND VS. RESERVED Two tiers of pricing plan are available for any VMware Shared virtual data center environment: on-demand or reserved . On-demand allocates virtual data center virtual CPU (vCPU) and RAM as needed. The amount of time that the allocation requires will depend upon the global demand (usage) of the virtual data center vCPU and RAM for the region in which the Shared plan is deployed. Allocations of vCPU and RAM, therefore, are scalable and can be adjusted over time. The price is calculated hourly and it is based on the resource usage in the virtual data center. Reserved pre-allocates the vCPU and RAM virtual data center reservations at deployment time and their availability afterwards is guaranteed; this contrasts sharply with on-demand deployments, where availability is a best-effort guarantee (but not at a certainty \u2014 as demand across the infrastructure region in which it is deployed may ebb and flow over time). The price is calculated monthly for the full duration of the reservation and it is based on the allocation size of the virtual data center. Select the On-Demand pricing plan. ADJUSTING COSTS Take note that the Summary panel at the far-right side of the IBM Cloud dashboard dynamically updates as you adjust configuration options on this page. Try out various options along the way to preview how these features impact the cost of a VMware Shared deployment. You can also read more about pricing within the About tab. Supply a unique and memorable Virtual data center name for your environment. Set the Resource Group to Enablement-L3 . This determines how resources are organized within your IBM Cloud account. Resource Groups cannot be changed for a service instance once it has been deployed. Deployment Topology SINGLE VS. MULTI-ZONE For every deployment of VMware Shared, there are two Topologies that a client may select from: single or multi-zone . A single zone VMware virtual data center deployment will provision the environment within a single available center (easier to manage, but potentially vulnerable to a single point of failure). A multi-zone VMware virtual data center deployment will deploy across two availability zones in an IBM Cloud multi-zone region, providing failover in the event that a single-zone data center failure occurs. Select the Single-zone VMware virtual data center topology. Geography should be set to the region located closest to your local area. Use the default value selected for Site . Use the default value selected for Location . Networking Types NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS VMware Shared on IBM Cloud supports two networking configurations: Public and Private or Private Only . The public network endpoints that are provisioned by default are the five public IP addresses that are displayed in the VMware Shared virtual data center details page. After the demonstration environment has provisioned, you will be able to go and inspect those for yourself. A private network endpoint allows a customer's IBM Cloud account devices or resources to connect to their virtual data centers by using the IBM Cloud private network. The private network endpoint service is available and ready to use in all virtual data centers provisioned through the IBM Cloud. To give the environment the widest range of options, select the Public and Private Networking option from the configuration panel. ADVANCED EDGE GATEWAY By default, every virtual data center comes configured with one advanced edge gateway, with five public IP addresses and one private service IP address. The advanced edge gateway is configurable by a customer and can be tailored to their specific needs. Connections to private network endpoints do not require public internet access. A private network endpoint provides a unique IP address that is accessible to customers without the need for a VPN connection. Private network endpoints support one-way traffic from IBM Cloud account resources to the virtual machines in a customer's virtual data center. There are several considerations to take into account creating a private network for VMware Shared, or any private network connection on IBM Cloud in general. They are: If you have an IBM Cloud Direct Link on your account, you must establish a tunnel between the cross-connect router and the customer edge to have access to the virtual data center. You can order only one private network endpoint per single-zone virtual data centers. For multi-zone virtual data centers, two private network endpoints must be ordered to correspond with each NSX Edge Service Gateway. If you want to change the device type of your private network endpoint, you must first delete the existing private network endpoint. Then, create a new private network endpoint with the new device type. You can simultaneously make resource updates to your virtual data center while you create or delete a private network endpoint.

It is measured in vCPU increments. Each vCPU increment represents a single 2.0 GHz core. Compute memory, or \"RAM limit\" as it is described on the IBM Cloud portal, is allocated in one gigabyte (GB) increments. RAM limits identify the maximum amount of random access memory available to each virtual data center. The limit placed on the maximum vCPU values determines the total number of processing units available for each virtual data center. Similarly, the RAM limit sets the maximum amount of memory available. You can adjust either of these values after you provision the virtual data center \u2014 giving customers the ability to scale and grow (or scale down) their virtual date center over time. Set the value of vCPU Limit to 1 . Set the value of RAM Limit to 1 . The least amount of vCPU that can be provisioned for any data center is 1 vCPU; RAM is likewise limited to a minimum of 1 GB. By setting both parameters to 1, the environment for this hands-on material will be as economically-priced as possible. Obviously, in the case of a real-world demonstration environment (or a production environment), you will want to size these appropriately to the anticipated workloads that the virtual server will be subject to. Storage When creating or deploying vApps / VMs, customers can select either an unencrypted or encrypted storage policy. Each option has six different tiers of storage available, depending on the storage performance required, with each option carrying a maximum throughput of IOPS (input-output operations per second) per gigabyte. How you are billed for storage, and the types of storage policies used, only come into effect after you have started deploying vApps or VMs within your VMware Shared plan. As we are not deploying code as part of this hands-on material, it is not necessary for us to worry about storage configurations at this time. WHERE'S MY STORAGE? Storage policy availability can vary by region and deployment topology. To inspect further details on the storage options available for any VMware Shared configuration, click the About tab at the top of the IBM Cloud catalog page. Encryption-enabled storage policies are available to all virtual data centers. Encryption protects not only the VMs but also VM disks and other files. Administrators can encrypt VMs and disks by associating the VM or disk with a storage policy that has enabled VM-encryption capabilities. For more information about the VM encryption limitations for VMware Cloud Director 10.3, see Enabling VM encryption on storage policies of an Organization virtual data center . Pre-Installed Services There are three services pre-installed with every deployment of VMware Shared on IBM Cloud. While they are ready for activation at any time, they are not free to use \u2014 if a customer wishes to make use of these services, they must agree to the terms of use license and incur the costs associated with that add-on service. If the pre-installed service is never activated or used, no additional charges will be leveed against the VMware Shared customer. These services, as described, are pre-installed with every VMware Shared deployment on IBM Cloud. We will not be making use of these services for the purposes of this hands-on lab and as such they can be ignored for now. The pre-installed services include: Veeam Availability Suite : Veeam enables secure backups to VMware Shared workloads. It also packages capabilities for meeting recovery objectives, cloud-based disaster recovery backups, as well as monitoring and reporting capabilities. Veeam Cloud Connect Replication : Extends on-premises Veeam environments to IBM Cloud, providing a secure and resilient disaster recovery environment. Zerto : Replicates VMs between data centers in the public cloud, or between public cloud and on-premises data centers. After Placing An Order When satisfied with the configuration options, inspect the far-right side of the IBM Cloud interface to confirm your costs and agree to the terms of service. As mentioned before, ensure you are using the ITZ-VMWARE account before deploying a VMware Shared plan , or risk incurring charges on your personal credit card. Verify that you have read and agree to the terms of service. Click Create to initiate the deployment of the VMware Shared service on IBM Cloud. Once you click Confirm , the deployment of the resources starts automatically and a message will be displayed on the IBM Cloud interface explaining that the order is being processed. You can check the deployment status, including any issues that might require your attention, by viewing the Resources tab from the VMware Solutions dashboard . Return to the VMware Solutions dashboard and drill down into Resources > VMware Shared to monitor the progress of your deployment. Once the resources have been successfully deployed, the components that are described within the technical specifications documentation for VMware Shared will be installed within your VMware virtual platform environment. When the resources are ready to use, the status will be changed to Ready . When ready, proceed to the Managing module of this hands-on documentation.","title":"Provisioning"},{"location":"Shared/Provisioning/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Provisioning/#pricing-plans","text":"ON-DEMAND VS. RESERVED Two tiers of pricing plan are available for any VMware Shared virtual data center environment: on-demand or reserved . On-demand allocates virtual data center virtual CPU (vCPU) and RAM as needed. The amount of time that the allocation requires will depend upon the global demand (usage) of the virtual data center vCPU and RAM for the region in which the Shared plan is deployed. Allocations of vCPU and RAM, therefore, are scalable and can be adjusted over time. The price is calculated hourly and it is based on the resource usage in the virtual data center. Reserved pre-allocates the vCPU and RAM virtual data center reservations at deployment time and their availability afterwards is guaranteed; this contrasts sharply with on-demand deployments, where availability is a best-effort guarantee (but not at a certainty \u2014 as demand across the infrastructure region in which it is deployed may ebb and flow over time). The price is calculated monthly for the full duration of the reservation and it is based on the allocation size of the virtual data center. Select the On-Demand pricing plan. ADJUSTING COSTS Take note that the Summary panel at the far-right side of the IBM Cloud dashboard dynamically updates as you adjust configuration options on this page. Try out various options along the way to preview how these features impact the cost of a VMware Shared deployment. You can also read more about pricing within the About tab.

MULTI-ZONE For every deployment of VMware Shared, there are two Topologies that a client may select from: single or multi-zone . A single zone VMware virtual data center deployment will provision the environment within a single available center (easier to manage, but potentially vulnerable to a single point of failure). A multi-zone VMware virtual data center deployment will deploy across two availability zones in an IBM Cloud multi-zone region, providing failover in the event that a single-zone data center failure occurs.

The public network endpoints that are provisioned by default are the five public IP addresses that are displayed in the VMware Shared virtual data center details page. After the demonstration environment has provisioned, you will be able to go and inspect those for yourself. A private network endpoint allows a customer's IBM Cloud account devices or resources to connect to their virtual data centers by using the IBM Cloud private network. The private network endpoint service is available and ready to use in all virtual data centers provisioned through the IBM Cloud. To give the environment the widest range of options, select the Public and Private Networking option from the configuration panel. ADVANCED EDGE GATEWAY By default, every virtual data center comes configured with one advanced edge gateway, with five public IP addresses and one private service IP address. The advanced edge gateway is configurable by a customer and can be tailored to their specific needs. Connections to private network endpoints do not require public internet access. A private network endpoint provides a unique IP address that is accessible to customers without the need for a VPN connection. Private network endpoints support one-way traffic from IBM Cloud account resources to the virtual machines in a customer's virtual data center. There are several considerations to take into account creating a private network for VMware Shared, or any private network connection on IBM Cloud in general. They are: If you have an IBM Cloud Direct Link on your account, you must establish a tunnel between the cross-connect router and the customer edge to have access to the virtual data center. You can order only one private network endpoint per single-zone virtual data centers. For multi-zone virtual data centers, two private network endpoints must be ordered to correspond with each NSX Edge Service Gateway. If you want to change the device type of your private network endpoint, you must first delete the existing private network endpoint. Then, create a new private network endpoint with the new device type. You can simultaneously make resource updates to your virtual data center while you create or delete a private network endpoint.
